# Old World Paper Mill (Lion053)

## Building

This mod adds an advanced paper mill which lets you produce paper in the Old World.

- The paper mill is a recipe building.
- This mod comes with two default recipes.
    - Paper from working clothes.
    - Paper from wood, cement and sulfide. Sulfide can be obtained by building sulfide modules next to iron, copper or zinc mines. This sulfur module requires coal as an input, increases the required workforce of the mine by 10 % and buffs the mine to produce a sulfur unit after 3 cycles. Tweak the output cycle with IMYA to your liking.
