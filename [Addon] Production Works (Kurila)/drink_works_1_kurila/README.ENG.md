# Drink Works 1

- Schnapps and Beer now need Clay **OR** Glass to be produced.
  - A Clay Sink has been added for the production of Schnapps by the Farmer. It is placed on a Clay Deposit and can be developed into a Clay Pit at Workers.
  - As before, glass is only unlocked at artisans, until then clay must be used.
