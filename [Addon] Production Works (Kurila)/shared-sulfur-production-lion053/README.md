# Sulfur Production (Lion053)

Sulfur can be obtained by building Sulfur Modules next to iron, copper or zinc mines.
The sulfur module requires coal as an input, increases the required workforce of the mine by 10 % and buffs the mine to produce a sulfur unit after 3 cycles.
Import with Docklands-DLC possible.
