# Shared Info Parts

Contains text modules for an extended InfoDescription.
There are also some minor changes to vanilla texts.

## Use Info Parts in your Mod

Take the building blocks for "Demand" and "Supply" which are provided by this mod and build them into your InfoDescription via [AssetData(XXX) Text].

After each [AssetData(XXX) Text] entry for "Demand" and "Supply" you set your own text modules.

I recommend defining each text module via a GUID and inserting it with [AssetData(XXX) Text]. Otherwise the code will be much too long and confusing with several entries.

- &#xD;&#xA = Line break

- &lt;b&gt;XXX&lt;/b&gt = XXX are Capitalised

- &lt;font overrideTextColor="true" color='#edc891'&gt;XXX&lt;/font&gt; = XXX becomes coloured

- &lt;img height='24' width='24' src="[AssetData(XXX) Icon]"/&gt; = Icon of XXX is displayed

- [AssetData(XXX) Text] = Text from XXX is displayed

- The colour that the font should take is set via hex values.
  To create these hex values, the mod comes with the "colourpicker" chrome application from modder Fam. You can use it to select a colour and the appropriate value is generated.
  However, it is important to know that only RGB is used in the game, but the colourpicker generates RGBA. The last two numbers/letters must be removed from the generated hex value.

This would be a text block for an input/output. It is started with the opening tag for colouring

```xml
<Text>&lt;font overrideTextColor="true" color='#edc891'&gt;
```

Then follows a tag to capitalise the text "1t", it is best to put a space after the end of the capitalisation tag.

```xml
&lt;b&gt;1t&lt;/b&gt;
```

After that comes the entry for displaying an icon (Bread in this case). It is also best to leave a space after the Icon tag.

```xml
&lt;img height='24' width='24' src="[AssetData(1010213) Icon]"/&gt;

```

Now follows the entry for the name of the product (in this case bread).

```xml
[AssetData(1010213) Text]
```

Now the colouring tag is closed.

```xml
&lt;/font&gt;
```

At the end, you can add a line break. In this way, the next text block you start would begin directly on a new line.

```xml
&#xD;&#xA;
```

This is what it looks like when finished.

```xml
    <Text>
      <GUID>XXX</GUID>
      <Text>&lt;font overrideTextColor="true" color='#edc891'&gt;&lt;b&gt;1t&lt;/b&gt; &lt;img height='24' width='24' src="[AssetData(1010213) Icon]"/&gt; [AssetData(1010213) Text]&lt;/font&gt;&#xD;&#xA;</Text>
    </Text>
```

That is one of the text modules.

For the finished InfoDescription, these text blocks are joined together via [AssetData(XXX) Text].

To do this, start with the "Demand" text block that provides this mod.

```xml
<Text>[AssetData(1500300045) Text]
```

then set a line break, but you can also write this at the beginning of the text block that is to follow "Demand".

```xml
&#xD;&#xA;
```

Now comes the created text block for the first input

```xml
[AssetData(XXX) Text]
```

You can now append more text blocks if you want to display several inputs.

```xml
[AssetData(XXX2) Text][AssetData(XXX3) Text][AssetData(XXX4) Text]
```

The following is the "supply" text block provided by this mod. Either place 2 line breaks bevor this to create a line space, or place them at the end of the last text block before "Supply".

```xml
&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[AssetData(1500300046) Text]
```

After this, you also set a line break, if you have not written it in the first text block after "Supply".

```xml
&#xD;&#xA;
```

A text block is also used here as after "Demand". Therefore, we use the familiar block here.

```xml
[AssetData(XXX) Text]</Text>
```

In the end, the text for the InfoDescription looks like this

```xml
<Text>[AssetData(1500300045) Text]&#xD;&#xA;[AssetData(XXX) Text]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[AssetData(1500300046) Text][AssetData(XXX) Text]</Text>
```
