This mod is an update of the original mod by nerses28 (www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/351).
Since he has less time for modding, he allowed me to make an update.

The legendary specialists and items pack adds various legendary specialist and items (there are only 19 items yet but there will be more in the next version :) ). Use this mod only if you want to make your game easier (items are very unbalanced).

Some items and specialists appear at pirates and Old Nate, the rest can be obtained as "normal" legendary items. Langs: English, Russian. GUID-Range: 1900000000-1900000042.
